## PowerShell is installed

I just thought it might be useful to have.  That is a linux version of powershell. ï¿¼
Start the container and run pwsh to get a powershell command line.
I'm thinking that maybe that gets its own container so that the libraries can be installed, or maybe just in this container
I may remove it entirely since you cannot manage a windows box from a linux version of Powershell.  No wmi commands...  Although you can use ssh with it.
