TBD

## What's installed
- Ansible
- Inspec
- Terraform
- Packer
- OpenTofu
- Powershell

## PowerShell is installed
* See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/whats-new/unix-support?view=powershell-7.4&viewFallbackFrom=powershell-7.2

I just thought it might be useful to have.  That is a linux version of powershell. ï¿¼
Start the container and run pwsh to get a powershell command line.
I'm thinking that maybe that gets its own container so that the libraries can be installed, or maybe just in this container
I may remove it entirely since you cannot manage a windows box from a linux version of Powershell.  No wmi commands...  Although you can use ssh with it.

## TODO
- command history
- fzf, exa/eza, etc
- tldr, tealdeer, man pages, other docs

## Build
Build the container
```
docker build --tag syseng:latest .
```
